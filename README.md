ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Simulation using ESP32  

This project simulates a traffic light system using an ESP32 microcontroller and three LEDs (red, yellow, green).  
The program runs in a continuous loop, controlling the LEDs based on typical traffic light sequences.  

## ðŸ”§ Features  
- Controls three LEDs to simulate a traffic light system  
- Uses ESP32 GPIO pins for LED control  
- Implements time delays to match real traffic light intervals  
- Can be tested on Wokwi Simulator before running on actual hardware
